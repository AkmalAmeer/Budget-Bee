# Budget-Bee

Budget Bee is a dynamic expense tracker application designed to help users efficiently manage their finances. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on expenses, making it easy to log and adjust their financial records. Users can analyze their spending patterns using a pie chart feature that visually breaks down expenses by category, giving clear insights into where their money goes. With Budget Bee, users can also keep track of their remaining budget, ensuring they stay on top of their financial goals and avoid overspending.
